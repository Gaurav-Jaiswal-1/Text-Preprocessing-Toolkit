## Features

- **Tokenization**: Split text into individual words or sentences.
- **Lemmatization**: Reduce words to their base or dictionary form.
- **Stop Word Removal**: Eliminate common words that do not contribute significant meaning.
- **Text Normalization**: Convert text to a consistent format, such as lowercasing.
- **Customizable Options**: Easily configure each preprocessing step to suit your needs.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install text-preprocessing-toolkit
```

For development purposes, including optional dependencies for testing and linting, run:

```bash
pip install text-preprocessing-toolkit[dev]
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s how to use the toolkit in your Python code:

### Basic Example

```python
from text_preprocessing_toolkit import TextPreprocessor

# Create a TextPreprocessor instance with default settings
preprocessor = TextPreprocessor()

# Example text
text = "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is fascinating!"

# Perform preprocessing
processed_text = preprocessor.preprocess(text)

print(processed_text)
```

### Customization Options

You can customize the behavior of the `TextPreprocessor` by specifying parameters during instantiation:

```python
preprocessor = TextPreprocessor(
    remove_stopwords=True,
    lemmatize=True,
    lowercase=True
)
```

## API Reference

### TextPreprocessor Class

The `TextPreprocessor` class is the main interface for preprocessing text. You can create an instance of this class and call its methods to preprocess your text.

#### Constructor

```python
TextPreprocessor(remove_stopwords=False, lemmatize=False, lowercase=False)
```

- `remove_stopwords` (bool): Set to `True` to remove stop words during preprocessing.
- `lemmatize` (bool): Set to `True` to apply lemmatization.
- `lowercase` (bool): Set to `True` to convert text to lowercase.

#### Preprocessing Methods

- `preprocess(text: str) -> str`:
  - **Description**: Process the input text based on the specified configuration.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `text` (str): The text to be processed.
  - **Returns**: The processed text as a string.

### Example

```python
text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
processed = preprocessor.preprocess(text)
print(processed)  # Output will depend on the configured options
```
